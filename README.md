# D10X

  I have selected the second problem(anagrams) out of the three problems that you have given. I have solved that problem in two approaches.
  ## 1st approach 
  by using the sort method: all anagrams are equal strings if they are sorted
  ## 2nd approach
  by using a unique encoded string for each set of anagrams. i.e the frequency of characters of each string in one anagram set will be equal. so I have written a function to        transform instead of sorting the string.
